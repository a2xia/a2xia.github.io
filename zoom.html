<h1>How to Install Zoom on your iPad (A step-by-step visual guide)</h1>

Greetings! In this visual step-by-step guide, I will show you how to install the ZOOM Cloud Meetings app onto your Apple iPad.

<h4>Step 1. Open the Apple App Store on your iPad</h4>
<p>The App Store icon is circled in red below.</p>

<h4>Step 2. Navigate to the "Search" tab at the bottom-right corner (circled in red below)</h4>

<h4>Step 3. Under the "Search" heading, tap the "Games, App, Stories, and More" search box and enter "Zoom"</h4>

<h4>Step 4. After searching for "Zoom", the following options should appear. The first app, "ZOOM Cloud Meetings" is the one you want. Tap on the name or icon</h4>

<h4>Step 5. Ensure that you are seeing something similar to the following image. If so, tap on "Get".</h4>
<p>If the "Get" button does not exist, and in its place an icon similar to a cloud with an arrow pointing downwards exists, that's fine. Tap the cloud with arrow icon to download. It simply means that you have either previously downloaded ZOOM and uninstalled it, or have installed ZOOM on another device with your Apple ID sign-in (e.g. your phone, or your kids' phone if you use the same account for your family)</p>

<h4>Step 6. Now it will ask for your confirmation. Tap on "Install"</h4>

<h4>Step 7. At this point, Apple <i>may</i> (or may not!) ask you for your Apple ID password. Enter it and tap "Sign In" if it asks at this stage</h4>
<p>In general, we want to be weary about entering passwords/log-in information, but if your screen appears similar to the image below, it's the Apple App Store asking, which is a safe opportunity to enter your password.</p>

<h4>Step 8. After you've entered your password (or tapped "Install" if it didn't ask for your password), the ZOOM app should begin downloading. You should now be able to find the app on your iPad's home screen.</h4>

<h4>If you see the ZOOM app installed - congratulations! You now have ZOOM installed on your Apple iPad. Next, we will discuss how to join meetings with the ZOOM app.</h4>
