      <h2>"Look around you, one person for every four won't be here by next year" - Your 1B Term in ECE</h2>
<p align="justify">On the first day of Orientation, we had a nice welcome speech from the Dean of Engineering informing us that we had about a 25% first-year "attrition" rate - people who fail out, quit, or realize ECE is not for them. Although this information is not made public (as far as I know), we were shown data in our 'homeroom' class that says about 25% of Computer Engineers leave by the end of first year, and about 16% of Electricals do the same. I think the most important message to understand this term is: if you don't feel that ECE is right for you, <i>don't feel bad about switching out</i>.</p>

<p>
	<ul><b>The Courses You'll Take:</b>

		<li><a href="#MATH119">MATH 119: Calculus 2 for Engineering</a></li>
	</ul>

	<section id="ECE102">
	<h4>ECE 102: Information Session <i>(formerly known as ECE 100B)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">Unliked ECE 100B, this "course" isn't a course at all - you'll see that its credit weight is 0.00. I presume that this means this course will entirely be, as the name suggests, an information session for the department to convey important news/updates, unlike in 100B where there were some little learning modules on things such as teamwork and project management.</p></section>

	<section id="ECE106">
	<h4>ECE 106: Electricity and Magnetism <i>(formerly known as Physics 2)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">Oh boy, this is probably the most hated-course in second year ECE. If you took AP Physics C (but let’s be honest here, who actually did?) it would be mostly review. In this course you’ll learn about the Second Unification of Physics, Maxwell’s Laws, Gauss Law, Faraday’s Law, Ampere's Law, Lenz’s Law, etc. The course coordinator almost every term for this course is Prof. Firas Mansour. My recommendation is to utilize his office hours, he is a very nice and helpful person even if his exams are… slightly convoluted. But at the end of the day, don’t worry too much, you’ll ride the curve to pass. There is a three-hour lab session every other week, which you will want to do well in as it will boost your final grade, and for some people it was the factor that carried them over the "pass" line. There's also a two-hour weekly tutorial, and similar to ECE 105 in 1A the first hour will be for problem solving, and the second for a quiz with individual and group portions.</p></section>

	<section id="ECE108">
	<h4>ECE 108: Discrete Mathematics and Logic 1 <i>(formerly known as ECE 103: Discrete Math)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">In the infinite wisdom of the ECE department, they decided that one discrete math course for engineers wasn’t enough, so they split up the old 103 course into two courses: ECE 108 and ECE 208. Also in their infinite wisdom, they decided that instead of getting a Math Faculty person to teach this course, that we have competent professors in the ECE department that can teach discrete math. Now, this course is brand new and no one’s ever taken it before, but it should mostly overlap with 103 content according to the <a href="http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/1718/COURSE/course-ECE.html#ECE100S">Undergraduate Calendar</a>. If so, you'll learn about four major topics: counting, proofs, number theory, and graph theory (hence the catch-call term "Discrete" mathematics).</p>

	<p>You may have seen counting-type problems on math contests such as the Euclid, for example, "How many ways can you line up the Seven Dwarfs such that Sleepy is not next to Happy?". You'll learn about counting rules, permutations, and the <i>n-choose-k</i> formula. Proofs are a lot trickier. No, they're not like those "trig proofs" you did in high school. These are mathematical proofs that are mostly words. For example, "Prove that for any integer <i>k</i>, if 3<i>k</i>+1 is even, the <i>k</i> is odd". You'll learn tricks such as 'proof by contrapositive', 'proof by induction' (everyone's favourite), or 'proof by "assume the instructor is right" '. Number theory covers topics such as prime numbers, modularity, greatest-common-divisors, etc. It mostly involves proving statements, but with different tricks and theorems. Finally, graph theory covers some basic graph theorems (such as Kuratowski's Theorem or Prim's Algorithm) and you use these theorems to prove more claims.</p>

	<p>There is a weekly two-hour tutorial in which the first hour will be for problem solving and the second hour features a quiz. Now, these quizzes are worth very little in the overall scheme of things (1% each quiz, lowest 2 quizzes dropped, at least under the ECE 103 scheme). However, very few people scored high on these quizzes and quite often most people would fail, and eventually many students began skipping tutorials because it made very little difference in their grades whether or not they showed up for the quiz. My recommendation is to not do that, and write the quizzes, for the feedback if not for the grade. You'll also have something to ask your instructor when you go (and you inevitably will go) to their office hours. I heard that there will be an added lab portion with some coding involved for the new ECE 108 course, since otherwise there will be no coding in 1B ECE (they got rid of ECE 155 to make room for ECE 140). Discrete math seems to me like one of those courses where you either "get it" or you "don't", since it sometimes requires unconventional and 'out-of-the-box' thinking. My advice is to use your instructor's office hours, and to also purchase the course notes for this course (assuming they will still use the same notes). And at the end of the day, there's nothing better than practice, practice, and more practice!</p>
	</section>

	<h4>ECE 124: Digital Circuits and Systems</h4>
	<p align="justify">In this course you'll learn about Boolean logic, logic gates, combinational/sequential circuit design, and synchronous/asynchronous circuits. There is also a lab component in which you will be programming a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with the VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language; VHSIC in turn is short for Very-High-Speed-Integrated-Circuit) programming language.</p>

	<h4>ECE 140: Linear Circuits <i>(moved from 1A)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">This course used to be in the 1A term, but in the infinite wisdom of the ECE department they decided to move it to 1B. This move makes sense, as by now you should know linear algebra (very useful in this course), and it shortens the time gap until your next circuits course (the criticism before was that by the time students got to ECE 240 in the 2A term, they had forgotten almost everything from 140 a year ago!). You probably did not get much background of this course in high school, unless you learned KCL/KVL in physics, but even then it's 95% new content. You'll learn things such as nodal/mesh analysis, phasor representations, and complex power.</p>

	<h4>MATH 119: Calculus 2 for Engineers</h4>
	This course contains two big topics: the first half being approximations. You'll learn about Taylor Polynomials, Big-O notation, etc. The second half is multivariate calculus. You'll essentially re-learn integration and differentiation, except now instead of one variable you could have multiple variables.</p>
