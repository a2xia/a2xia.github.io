# Journey to Sri Lanka

This idea to visit Sri Lanka originally started with a plan to tour the three countries that three of my very close friends were from - India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, Nepal got cut out of the plan when I found out how difficult transportation was to get there, espcially for a solo traveler, and India got cut because there just wasn't enough time to cover many parts of the country. Sri Lanka, it turned out, seemed to have the best balance of natural scenery and logistical convenience of the three.

As per usual on my travels, I kept a travel journal on my trip and made notes about the places I visited. Notes and photos will be shared here.

The below is some pre-departure information that I researched prior to arriving in Sri Lanka in November of 2018. The information below (and throughout this site) may be outdated or inaccurate, so please use at your own risk, and if you're a lawyer, please read the [disclaimer](/disclaimer.html).

Emergencies in Sri Lanka: Ambulance and Fire: 110 or 011-242 2222; Police 119 or 011-243 3333; Medi-Calls Private Ambulance 011-255 6605; Tourist Police 1912 or 011-242 1052. The High Commission of Canada to Sri Lanka is located at 33-A 5th Lane, Colombo 03, Sri Lanka (P.O. Box 1006, Colombo). Tel: 94 (11) 532-6232 / 94 (11) 522-6232. Email: clmbo-cs@international.gc.ca. Emergency collect call to Ottawa: +1 613 996 8885.

As of August 2018, 1 CAD = 121 Sri Lankan Rupees. By end of the trip, 1 CAD = 134.5 Rupees due to political instability in Sri Lanka. In fact, local vendors told me they had to recalculate prices daily against the USD. Thirty-day visitor visas cost US$25 to US$100, depending on nationality (Canadians: US$35). Apply in advance online (www.eta.gov.lk), you can obtain your Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) before booking your ticket. The country code is +94. When booking Sri Lankan hotels, note that Sri Lankan national and city taxes often are not included in the price you see. This can add 25-30% to the displayed price! Sri Lanka Standard Time is GMT+5.5, 2.5 hours behind Beijing, 12.5 hours ahead of Vancouver, and 9.5 ahead of Toronto.

Watch out for poya (full moon) nights, when celebrations take place across the country. Full moons in Sri Lanka are due on Nov 23 and Dec 22 in 2018.

Trains in Sri Lanka are run by Sri Lanka Government Railways. All trains have 2nd and 3rd class carriages whose tickets cannot sell-out - worst case, you'll have to stand. Often these tickets are only sold on the day of at the ticket office, sometimes from only an hour before departure. Many trains (except on the Colombo-Galle-Matara Southern line) have reserved 1st class or Observation cars - these can be booked up to 30 days in advance, and often sell out immediately after they become available. To pre-book tickets, they need to be done through an agency and if done more than 32 days before travel: 12go.asia is a reliable operator, but they only sell tickets for outbound journeys from Colombo, not inbound. tourmastertravelservices.com, VisitSriLankaTours are two other recommended agencies.
