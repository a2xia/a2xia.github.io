    <h2>1B ECE</h2>
    <p></p>
  </header>

  <section class="wrapper style5">
    <div class="inner">
      <h2>"Look around you, one person for every four won't be here by next year" - Your 1B Term in ECE</h2>
<p align="justify">On the first day of Orientation, we had a nice welcome speech from the Dean of Engineering informing us that we had about a 25% first-year "attrition" rate - people who fail out, quit, or realize ECE is not for them. Although this information is not made public (as far as I know), we were shown data in our 'homeroom' class that says about 25% of Computer Engineers leave by the end of first year, and about 16% of Electricals do the same. I think the most important message to understand this term is: if you don't feel that ECE is right for you, <i>don't feel bad about switching out</i>.</p>

<p>
	<ul><b>The Courses You'll Take:</b>
		<li>ECE 102: Information Session <i>(formerly known as ECE 100B)</i></li>
		<li>ECE 106: Electricity and Magnetism <i>(formerly known as Physics 2)</i></li>
		<li>ECE 108: Discrete Mathematics and Logic 1 <i>(formerly known as ECE 103)</i></li>
		<li>ECE 124: Digital Circuits and Systems</li>
		<li>ECE 140: Linear Circuits <i>(moved from 1A)</i></li>
		<li>MATH 119: Calculus 2 for Engineering</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>ECE 102: Information Session <i>(formerly known as ECE 100B)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">Unliked ECE 100B, this "course" isn't a course at all - you'll see that its credit weight is 0.00. I presume that this means this course will entirely be, as the name suggests, an information session for the department to convey important news/updates, unlike in 100B where there were some little learning modules on things such as teamwork and project management.</p>

	<h4>ECE 106: Electricity and Magnetism <i>(formerly known as Physics 2)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">Oh boy, this is probably the most hated-course in second year ECE. If you took AP Physics C (but let’s be honest here, who actually did?) it would be mostly review. In this course you’ll learn about the Second Unification of Physics, Maxwell’s Laws, Gauss Law, Faraday’s Law, Lenz’s Law, etc. The course coordinator almost every term for this course is Prof. Firas Mansour. My recommendation is to utilize his office hours, he is a very nice and helpful person even if his exams are… slightly convoluted. But at the end of the day, don’t worry too much, you’ll ride the curve to pass.</p>

	<h4>ECE 108: Discrete Mathematics and Logic 1 <i>(formerly known as ECE 103: Discrete Math)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">In the infinite wisdom of the ECE department, they decided that one discrete math course for engineers wasn’t enough, so they split up the old 103 course into two courses: ECE 108 and ECE 208. Also in their infinite wisdom, they decided that instead of getting a Math Faculty person to teach this course, that we have competent professors in the ECE department that can teach discrete math. Now, this course is brand new and no one’s ever taken it before, so there’s not much I can say about it. However, I heard that there will be an added lab portion with some coding involved.</p>

	<h4>ECE 124: Digital Circuits and Systems</h4>
	<p align="justify">In this course you'll learn about Boolean logic, logic gates, combinational/sequential circuit design, and synchronous/asynchronous circuits. There is also a lab component in which you will be programming a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with the VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language; VHSIC in turn is short for Very-High-Speed-Integrated-Circuit) programming language.</p>

	<h4>ECE 140: Linear Circuits <i>(moved from 1A)</i></h4>
	<p align="justify">This course used to be in the 1A term, but in the infinite wisdom of the ECE department they decided to move it to 1B. This move makes sense, as by now you should know linear algebra (very useful in this course), and it shortens the time gap until your next circuits course (the criticism before was that by the time students got to ECE 240 in the 2A term, they had forgotten almost everything from 140 a year ago!). You probably did not get much background of this course in high school, unless you learned KCL/KVL in physics, but even then it's 95% new content. You'll learn things such as nodal/mesh analysis, phasor representations, and complex power.</p>

	<h4>MATH 119: Calculus 2 for Engineers</h4>
	This course contains two big topics: the first half being approximations. You'll learn about Taylor Polynomials, Big-O notation, etc. The second half is multivariate calculus. You'll essentially re-learn integration and differentiation, except now instead of one variable you could have multiple variables.</p>
