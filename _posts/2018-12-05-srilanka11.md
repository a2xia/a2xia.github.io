From Lonely Planet: "Galle (pronounced in Sinhala as 'Gaal-le') is the most important town in the south and its fort area, with its mighty ramparts, encloses some wonderful examples of colonial architecture. A laid-back and enchanting place to wander, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988. Be sure to find a table for dinner before 9pm as the town gets sleepy fast. Also, many places do not serve any alcohol. Few places are air-conditioned, so dinner is usually a better option for a relaxed meal."

Connecting from the Night Mail sleeper train, the first departure out of Colombo Fort is #8050 6:55 and arrives Galle 9:19 (direction Matara). But since the Night Mail train arrived 2h45 minutes late (at nearly 8AM), bought a ticket for the 8:35 departure, which was incredibly full with foreigners. Air Conditioned Highway Bus may be a better option.

* Stay: Beach Haven (Mrs ND Wijenayake's) Guest House: The wonderful Mrs Wijenayake (former deputy mayor of Galle) and her family have been hosting grateful backpackers since 1968 here. Lonely Planet recommended, and cofounder Tony Wheeler had an extended stay here in 1977. Booked with Booking.com for US$34. No CC info provided during booking. 65 Light House Street, Galle Fort. +94 912 234 663.
