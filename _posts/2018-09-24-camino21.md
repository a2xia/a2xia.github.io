# On the Camino, Day 21: Le&oacute;n to San Marti&iacute;n del Camino

### 310.0 km to Santiago de Compostela

So far, we have been following the stages of the Camino set out in the "Pilgrims Guide to the Camino" guidebook, and today it recommended a 21 km stage from Le&oacute;n to Villadangos del P&aacute;ramo, followed by a 29 km stage the next day to Astorga. I looked at today and tomorrow's maps, and realized that it actually made more sense to go further today, to San Mart&iacute;n, an additional 4.7 km away where there were more beds, and it would prevent a super long day tomorrow.

We woke up in the AirBnB in Le&oacute;n at 5 once again, and had the breakfast that we bought last night. We left by 6 to start walking. It took a while to walk out of Le&oacute;n's urban sprawl and we reached our first village of the day, La Virgen del Camino, by 7:30, where we stopped for breakfast and an omelette. We also passed by Valverde and San Miguel before arriving at Villadangos at about 10:30. We were both hungry, but we found that the only cafe in town was closed on Mondays. So, we had a short break and ate some granola bars and peaches, and then continued to San Mart&iacute;n.

We checked in to the municipal *albergue* as soon as they opened at noon, and I showered before we went out for food. There was a bar that served no food and a restaurant that wasn't open, so we had to backgrack to the Albergue Vieira which had some food, and we split a salad and had beers too. I napped in the afternoon as usual, and dinner was the usual loaf of bread.
