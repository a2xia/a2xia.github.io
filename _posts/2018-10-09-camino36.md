# On the Camino Fisterra, Day 36: Lago to Cee

The beds in the Albergue Monte Aro were really comfortable, so I slept well last night. It was 7 when we woke up for bread and coffee in the albergue, then we left at 7:50. We made it to Olveiroa by 9:15 for real coffee and toast with ham at Casa Manola, and had lunch at Hospital. Here, the trail split into two, with one path going to Finisterre and the other to Muxia. We were going to Finisterre first, so we took the left route. Also to note here was that there is both an "Olveiroa" and an "Olveira" in this vicinity, two unique hamlets no doubt confusing plenty of pilgrims.

Entering Cee was a steep downhill drop, and from the bluffs our first views of the Atlantic Ocean were quite nice. We arrived at the Albergue Tequeron at 2:45 - good thing I had phoned beforehand to make a reservation, because it only had six beds! After showering and washing clothes, I napped for a while, then we went to the Gadis supermarket for dinner followed by a stroll around town.
