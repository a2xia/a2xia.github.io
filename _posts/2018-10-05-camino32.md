# On the Camino, Day 32: Arz&uacute;a to Pedrouzo

### 39.4 km to Santiago de Compostela

We decided to leave earlier in the morning after our "leave late" experiment days, so we were up at 6:30 and started walking at 7:30. I was starting to feel a bit sick (likely a cold), and sniffling the whole way. We had coffee at Bar-Cafe Lino in A Calle, then continued walking non-stop to Pedrouzo. Last night dad found an albergue there, the Albergue O Trsiquel, so I phoned ahead and booked us two beds. We arrived at 12:30 and checked in, but first we went to eat lunch.

I found a restaurant on Google Maps near the albergue - the Galacios restaurant, so we went there. It was a higher-scale restaurant. I had a veal chop that was too much, so I only ate about half. I napped in the afternoon, but in the albergue's living room on their sofa, since it was too hot in the bedroom.
