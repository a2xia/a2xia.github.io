# On the Camino, Day 16: Fr&oacute;mista to Carri&oacute;n de los Condes

### 424.4 km to Santiago de Compostela

**Summary**<br>
Distance: 19.3 km<br>
Breakfast: *Pan y M&aacute;s*, Fr&oacute;mista: &euro;? (we forgot to record it)<br>
Lunch: *Cafeteria los Condes*, Carri&oacute;n: &euro;19<br>
Dinner: DIY from D&iacute;a Supermarket, &euro;20,57 with breakfast for tomorrow morning<br>
Overnight: Casa de Esp&iacute;ritualidad Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Bel&eacute;n: &euro;44 for private room and washroom<br>

Today was another relatively short stage at just under 20 kilometres, so we woke up at 5:30 to pack up and left the municipal *albergue* at 6 to have breakfast at a nearby cafe in Fr&oacute;mista before starting our walk. Today we took an alternative route that didn't walk along the highway, instead we went along the river towards Carri&oacute;n. On this alternative route we passed by the villages of Poblaci&oacute;n de Campos, Villovieco, and Villalc&aacute;zar de Sirga before arriving at Carri&oacute;n de los Condes at around noon.

We went to the last-listed *albergue* in the guidebook, the Casa de Esp&iacute;ritualidad N.S. De Bel&eacute;n, at the far end of town, a former boarding school converted into an *albergue*, officially, but really I'd say it was more like a hotel. We got a double room with private washroom for 44 euros for the night, and showered before heading out for lunch and a stop at the grocery store to pick up dinner and breakfast for tomorrow morning.
