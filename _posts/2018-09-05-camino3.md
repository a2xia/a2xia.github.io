# On the Camino, Day 3: Zubiri to Pamplona

### 729.2 km to Santiago de Compostela

It began raining in the night in Zubiri, there was a thunderstorm as well and heavy rains. But when we woke up for our allotted 7 AM breakfast time at the aubergue, there seemed to be a momentary pause in the rain. We went downstairs for the hostel-provided "pilgrims' breakfast", which was bread and coffee.

After breakfast, we packed our bags and left Zubiri at 8, beginning the third stage of our walk. It started to rain after about an hour, so we put the covers on our bags and kept walking. We wanted to have lunch in the village of Irotz, but the cafe there wasn't open, so we ended up having to walk all the way to a suburb of Pamplona, Villava, where there was an aubergue with an attached restaurant. Oddly enough, the restaurant didn't serve lunch. Thankfully, around the corner, there was a donair and burger shop, and so I had a burger and salad before continuing.

Since we had planned for two nights in Pamplona, to save money we booked an AirBnB to stay at. The drawback was that it was far from the city itself, in a quiet residental neighbourhood. Also, we were going to arrive a bit early at 3 PM, so I contacted our host on Whatsapp and we waited at a nearby bar.
