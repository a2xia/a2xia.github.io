# On the Camino, Day 14: Hornillos to Castrojeriz

### 469.4 km to Santiago de Compostela
**Summary**<br>
Distance: 20.1 km<br>
Lunch: *La Taberna*, Castrojeriz: &euro;28,40<br>
Dinner: Albergue Rosalia, &euro;9<br>
Overnight: Albergue Rosalia, &euro;10/bed<br>

Since it was too sunny, too hot, and too dry during the day here in the Spanish *meseta*, we decided to start as early as possible in the morning to cover as much ground as possible before it got too hot. As such, we woke up at the Meeting Point Hostel in Hornillos del Camino at 5 AM when breakfast service started. I had two slices of bread and some baguette and two cups of coffee, and we were out the doors and walking by 5:50 AM. Of course, it was pitch black outside on the countryside trails, so we needed the headlamp for the first hour. However, it was possible to see the stars here in the wilderness with no light pollution, and I could even see the Milky Way. (*Editor's Note: Unfortunately, I didn't have the necessary camera technology to capture this beautiful sight, so you'll have either to take my word for it or go for yourself!*)

<p class=caption>457 kilometres, or 248 miles, or 95 leagues to go, according to the side of this building. I'm not sure which measurement is correct, because by my calculation 457 kilometres makes 284 miles. Even with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_customary_units">Spanish miles</a> the numbers don't line up. Don't get me started on the "Leagues" calculation - by these numbers, one "League" should be about 4.8 kilometres, so perhaps they meant an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_(unit)">English land league</a>?</p>

We passed by the crossing for San Sol, the first village that was a bit off the route, so we didn't stop by. By 8:30, it was light out, and we had reached the halfway point of today's stage (a shorter one at only 21 km) and the village of Hontanas. We stopped briefly to apply sunscreen, but otherwise we walked non stop all day. We passed by San Anton and the ruins of the old Monastery (the arch was still standing), and we reached the edge of Castrojeriz by a record 10:30 AM.

We walked first to our preferred *albergue*, the Albergue Rosalia, which I had tried to call last night but no one answered. When we got there, there was a sign on the door saying it opened at 12:15 AM, so I tried again to call and make a reservation, and the lady at the other end of the call asked when we would arrive. I said that we were in fact at their front door already, and so she welcomed us in to leave our bags and boots in the lobby while they finished cleaning up.

Since we had an early breakfast, I was hungry already, so we backtracked to a cafe near the town entrance that served food all day and we had two paellas (reheated, previously frozen) for lunch. We also had two coffees to kill time, then had a stop at the sole supermarket in town before going back to the *albergue* to check in.

I spent the afternoon napping until the "community dinner" service started at 7 PM. Dinner was salad, bread with hummus (nice touch), and paella (this time homemade in a *very* big pan before our very eyes) with chicken drumsticks and dessert and wine. Overall, it was a good meal and many other pilgrims agreed.
