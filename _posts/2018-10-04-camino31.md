# On the Camino, Day 31: Palas de Rei to Arz&uacute;a

### 68.2 km to Santiago de Compostela

Today's stage according to the guidebook was from Palas de Rei to this small hamlet called Ribadiso, but, just like three years ago, we decided to walk a bit further today to the city of Arz&uacute;a. We left Palas de Rei at a leisurely 7:50 and followed the heavy traffic of pilgrims on this last handful of kilometres to Santiago. We reached the city of Melide by lunchtime, and just like last time, had lunch at the Pulperia Garnacha and had a plate of octopus.

Even after lunch, it was almost four hours of walking to reach Arz&uacute;a (making today a very long stage), and we checked in to The Way Hostel at 4.
