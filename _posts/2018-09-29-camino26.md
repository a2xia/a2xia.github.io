# On the Camino, Day 26: Villafranca to O'Cebreiro

### 183.4 km to Santiago de Compostela

After the first stage from St-Jean to Roncesvalles, today was the next hardest stage of the Camino in my opinion. At 28.9 km long, it was already a long stage, but there was an approximately 700 metre elevation gain - 600 of which occured steeply in the last 6 or so kilometres. The "adjusted distance" accounting for elevation changes, according to the guidebook, was a whopping 33.4 kilometres.

We left the fantastic Albergue Leo at 5:50 (having an entire room to ourselves meant that we could pack up and get moving earlier in the morning) and started walking. The majority of the earlier part of today's stage was through the narrow valley ("vallis carceras", which gives its name to the village of Valcarce which we passed today), which was cold. A big portion of the route was walking along the N-VI national route from Madrid to A Coru&ntilde;a, but with the new A-6 freeway constructed in parallel with the old national route, hardly any cars were on the road anymore.

We passed by the first village of Pereje and stopped for coffee and the Nova Ruta cafe in Trabadelo. It was so cold this morning that right away in the next village of La Portela de Valcarce, we had another coffee and hot chocolate at the El Peregrino Restaurant and Albergue.

We passed by Ambasmestas, Vega de Valcarce, and Ruitelan before arriving in Las Herrerias at 11. We decided to stop here for lunch and to rest before tackling the steep climb, and so we lunched at the El Capricho de Josana.

The climb up, as one pilgrim we passed described it, was "not made for humans". It was steep, extremely rocky at parts, and every pilgrim we passed was sweating buckets. (Two local seniors passed us though, with no sign of fatigue at all). We should've taken the horses up in hindsight. (*Editor's Note: Yes, there was a cunning entrepreneur at the bottom of the climb advertising horseback rides to carry you and your pack up the mountain*). We passed by more villages on the way up - La Faba and Laguna de Castilla before arriving at O'Cebreiro. Although the distance wasn't long, I'd estimate that we were probably only covering a pace of 2.5 km/hour uphill.

Right before arriving in O'Cebreiro, we crossed the border between the regions of Castilla y Le&oacute;n and Galicia and into the Galician Province of Lugo. You could tell that the *Xunta de Galicia* (*Editor's Note: "Xunta" being the Galician word for Spanish "Junta", essentially the local Council*) took better care of pilgrims - the pathway improved significantly suddenly across the border line. 

In O'Cebreiro, there were only two hostels - the government-run *Xunta albergue* and a private one. Last night, I had the friendly *hospitalero* at the Albergue Leo phone ahead and try to make a reservation for us. Unfortunately, the private albergue (which only opened recently) was full. The *xunta albergue*, according to Google reviews, lacked shower curtains which is a big dealbreaker for me. (*Editor's Note: I'm pretty sure for most North Americans, it would be a dealbreaker for them too*)

So, we ended up splurging and booked a double room at the Hotel Cebreiro for fifty euros. We checked in at 2 and I quicked showered and soaked my clothes (I was too tired to wash them) and napped.

Once done with my nap, we went out to discover the village and buy some dinner bread. The views from the top of the mountain was quite nice and I took some pictures. We also stopped by the Tourist Information office, where they were able to help us book two beds at a private albergue at our next stop, Triacastela, because apparently the *xunta albergue* there has the same communal shower problem.
