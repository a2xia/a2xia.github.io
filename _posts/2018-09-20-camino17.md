# On the Camino, Day 17: Carri&oacute;n de los Condes to Terradillos de los Templarios

### 405.1 km to Santiago de Compostela

The Filipenses albergue/hotel told us last night that we couldn't leave before 6 AM, probably because all the Sisters were sleeping and hence no one would be able to unlock the door. Today was a long stage at 26.8 kilometres, including the long initial stretch of 17 kilometres between Carri&oacute;n and the first village of Calzadilla de la Cueza where there were no services in between. (Based on reading ahead in the guidebook, this was the longest stretch of wilderness on the Camino).

We woke up in our room at 5, and ate the croissants and p&acirc;t&eacute; we bought at the D&iacute;a Supermarket yesterday afternoon, and packed up and left the *albergue* at 6. The boring stretch of road was flat, paved, and straight on for about four hours. When we finally reached Calzadilla at around 10, we stopped for coffee and I had a slice of spinach quiche.

After our refuelling stop, it was another 10 kilometres to go. We passed by Ledigos before arriving at the hamlet of Terradillos de los Templarios (population listed in the guidebook as 80) a bit after noon. A former stronghold of the Knights of the Templar, not much remains apart from two albergues (with the first one technically outside of the town limits) and plenty of empty buildings. Given the limited number of beds here, I had called ahead last night and made a reservation at the Albergue Jacques de Molay, named after the last Grand Master of the Order. We got our beds and did the usual showering and clothes cleaning, and when the on-site restaurant opened for lunch at 2, we went to eat. I had a grilled chicken and dad a sandwich and we split the usual mixed salad.

After an afternoon nap, dinner was a loaf of bread and a beer we bought from the on-site grocery store. In fact, dad went out for a walk earlier and asked two locals where to get groceries, and they said that Terradillos is practically a ghost town now and even the few locals left go to the *albergue*'s in-house market.
