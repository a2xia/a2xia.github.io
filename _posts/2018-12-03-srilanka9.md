* 5:30a Guesthouse-arranged tuktuk to Lipton's Seat (Rs 1200). Guesthouse host claimed the ride would take "only 15 minutes", but I may have misheard and he may have meant *50* minutes, because it took nearly an hour.
* 6:30a Lipton's Seat: This lookout is said to be one of Sri Lanka's most impressive viewpoints (unless it's misty and cloudy of course, which is why early morning is the best time to visit). The Scottish tea baron Sir Thomas Lipton (whose name is now on the big Lipton's tea brand) used to sit at this viewpoint to contemplate and watch his burgeoning team empire. (Good old colonialist thinking...). To hike to the lookout, follow signed narrow paved road from the Dambatenne Tea Factory and climb about 8 km through the tea plantations. Also possible to drive up. Admission Rs 30 Locals, Rs 100 Foreigners, Rs 100 Vehicles. View was indeed spectacular - much better than World's End and much cheaper! Cafe at viewpoint sells tea at Rs 50 a cup and opens at 7am. Enjoyed a cup of tea along with the early-morning views and fresh air - highly recommended.
* 7:10a Began walking downhill towards Dambatenne. Walk took 1.5 hours, was able to cut off nearly two kilometres by following a local student through the tea fields instead of following the long-winding road.
* 8:40a Dambatenne Tea Factory: This popular tea factory was built in 1890 by Sir Thomas Lipton, and the tour they offer is the most comprehensive tea factory tour around. Unfortunately, no tours on Mondays (and today was a Monday) since no processing takes place, because yesterday was a Sunday and no tea-picking takes place on Sundays.
* Dambatenne is 9 km northeast of Haputale. Buses pass by the factory every 30 minutes, but negotiated a price of Rs 500 for a tuktuk back to Haputale in time for breakfast at Nature View Guest Inn before check-out.
* 10:00a Walked to train station, had a pot of tea at nearby cafe to wait for 11:13 "Goods Train" (Rs 300)
* 12:30p Train was delayed over an hour, of course. As the name implied, this train had a freight carriage and unloaded goods and packages at every stop, which took up lots of time. Only 3rd class seating available, not many tourists. Plenty of seating available, but I sat at the door and poked my head out of the train. (Trains move very slow, even in the event of falling off you can probably run and catch up, although I definitely advise against trying).
* 1:45p Arrival in Ella, walked to Alta Vista Hotel.
* 2:30 Late lunch at Cafe Chill, Rs 1155.
* Activities for the rest of the day (Nine Arch Bridge) cancelled due to incliment weather (thunderstorms and heavy fog)
* Stay: Alta Vista Hotel, Rs 5840. Originally booked The Bamboo, Wellawaya Road, 90090 Ella on Booking.com for USD 40.50, but four days prior to arrival they informed me that they could no longer honour the reservation due to construction works.
