# Sri Lanka Day 4: Kandy

<p class=caption>On board the train from Colombo to Kandy. Foreigners love poking their heads out the doors - the train is going slowly enough such that if you do fall off, you could probably jog a bit and catch up again.</p>

From Lonely Planet: "Sri Lanka's second largest city and cultural capital, [...] one of the most important symbols of Sinhalese national identity".

* Train 1009 departs daily from Colombo Fort at 7:00 AM and arrives Kandy at 9:31 AM, has an observation car. Rs 350 for 2nd Class ticket - the Intercity train seemed to be all reserved seating. To purchase tickets, go to ticket counter 17 at the Fort station (Intercity Reservations)
* Alternatively, Train 1015 (*Udarata Menike*) departs daily from Colombo Fort at 8:30 and arrives Kandy at 11:03, it is a new Chinese-built "blue train". (This train continues to Badulla)
* Breakfast from one of the many food stands near the Fort station: 2 samosas for Rs 150
* Train arrived in Kandy on time, checked in to hotel. Lunch at KFC and strolled around the lake, (Kandy Lake), then returned to hotel to avoid the heat
* Afternoon: Temple of the Tooth: Originally dated from the 16th century that houses the sacred Buddha's Tooth Relic. World Heritage Site. Entrance to the complex is in Palace Square opposite the Natha Devala. During *puja* (offerings or prayers), the heavily guarded room containing the tooth is opened to devotees and tourists. However, you don't actually see the tooth, as it's kept in a gold casket (and apparently there are actually six of them). *Rs 1500, Cameras Rs 150 (camera fee doesn't seem to be enforced, or at least not for cell phones). Wear trousers and ensure shoulders are covered, otherwise lungis (sarongs) must be worn over shorts. But the rule on appropriate wear seems to vary, I saw some people with slightly longer shorts get by while some had to wear sarongs. I'm told that a good rule of thumb is that if your knees are covered, you may be in a better spot. No shoes and hats allowed (small fee "by donation" outside the temple for storage). Temple 5:30a-8p, puja 5:30-6:45a, 9:30-11a, 6:30p-8p*)
* Also within the Temple compound (entrance included in Temple ticket):
    - Alut Maligawa Buddhist Temple: A large shrine hall displaying dozens of sitting Buddhas donated by devotees from Thailand. On the upper two floors is the Sri Dalada Museum (*Museum of the Sacred Tooth Relic*), displaying gifts from presidents and Buddhist leaders around the world. In the Museum, be cautious if any museum staff offers to "show" you how to perform a traditional Buddhist prayer on the replica of Buddha's footprint - hidden underneath the basket of flower pedals was a "donation" basket!
    - Audience Hall: North of the temple, an open-air pavillion.
    - World Buddhism Museum: Housed in the former High Court buildings, large number of statues actually reproductions. (*Rs 500*).
* Dinner at Kandy City Centre Mall "WorldSpice" Food Court, Rs 1300
* Stay: Meili Lanka City Hotel, No 110/B Yatinuwara Street. +94 814 946 966. Booked through Booking.com for US$16.50, includes 10% Genius discount.
* Info: Lonely Planet Guidebook Recommended Stay: Clock Inn Kandy: A well-set-up hostel with wacky rooftop capsule-style tube-beds and ample lounging zones, located close to the train station.
