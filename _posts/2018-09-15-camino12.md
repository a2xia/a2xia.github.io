# On the Camino, Day 12: San Juan de Ortega to Burgos

### 516.5 km to Santiago de Compostela

Since there were about twenty people packed into one room at the *parroquial* albergue in San Juan, every time I woke up there was at least one person snoring, many times multiple. It didn't lead to a good night's sleep, and everyone must've been early risers, because the lights were on by 6. There being no breakfast service at the albergue (and no services at all in fact in San Juan at this time), we were out the door by a record-early 6:53 and began walking in the dar. We needed to bring out the headlamps since the road was deserted and had no street lamps. We followed the trail through a sketchy section through the woods, and the sun was starting to rise by the time we arrived at the first village of Ag&eacute;s, 3.6 km down the trail.

In Ag&eacute;s we had breakfast and coffee before we stopped for a photo. We ran into a Brazilian fellow and a Japanese fellow (*Editor's Note: Names withheld for privacy*) who had become walking patneres, and we walked with them and chatted until we reached the next village of Atapuerca after another 2.5 km. It was really cold this morning, to the point that I needed to put on a jacket. It was especially cold when we reached the peak of the Matagrade, due to the wind. As such, we went quite quickly down the hillside and into the *meseta*, the endless boring flat plains region that stretches between Burgos and Le&oacute;n. We took the shorter path from the guidebook which meant we bypassed the villages of Villaval and Carde&ntilde;uela in the valley, and rejoined the Camino at Orbaneja, and continued past Burgos Airport to Casta&ntilde;ares where we stopped to have lunch.

After lunch, we took the recommended alternative route and walked along the riverside into Burgos and eventually to our AirBnb for the night (*Editor's Note: Burgos, being one of the larger cities along the routes, had AirBnBs*). Unfortunately, this AirBnB was on the (European) fifth (so, North American sixth) floor of an apartment building with no elevator. We were able to use the washing machie, so we took the opportunity to machine wash our clothes.

At about 4:30, we decided to head out into the old city. It was still really hot outside, so we made the quick walk to the Cathedral. Eventually, we found the visitor centre where we were able to get a stamp for our *credencial*. In the visitor centre, the French group recognized me and asked (in French, of course) how my day went.

After the Cathedral, we went and found a pharmacy to restock on moleskins for potential foot blisters and more sunscreen, then we went to a Dia supermarket to buy some dinner.
