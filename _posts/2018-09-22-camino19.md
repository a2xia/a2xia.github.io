# On the Camino, Day 19: Bercianos to Mansilla de la Mulas

### 354.8 km to Santiago de Compostela

I woke up at the Bercianos 1900 hostel in Bercianos del Real Camino before my alarm at 4:45, and dad was also up already. We quickly moved our bags downstairs to the kitchen area where we also ate the breakfast we bought last night. While we were eating, a fellow pilgrim from Minnesota told us that he couldn't find a way out - the door was locked. We tried calling the albergue's phone number but no one answered. He was seriously contemplating scaling the wall when the *hospitalerios* woke up and told him the key to the gate was on the reception desk.

We were out on our way by 5:40 AM, and it was a 7.4 kilometre walk in the dark to reach the first village of El Burgo Ranero. We stopped at the La Costa del Abode cafe for some coffee before continuing, and it was a lonely 13 kilometre stretch to the next village of Religos. Since breakfast was very light, both of us were hungry by the time we arrived, at around 10:40, so we stopped at the first restaurant in town, the Piedras Blancas, where I had a Spanish omelette and a sandwich. From there, it was just another hour and a half to reach today's destination of Mansilla de las Mulas, and we went directly to the municipal albergue.

Two nights ago, I had accidentally left behind my bath towel in Terradillos at the Jacques de Molay albergue, and yesterday in Bercianos I had noticed it missing and called the albergue. They said it was there, so I arranged for a delivery with Correos' Camino backpack service to have the towel shipped to Mansilla for five euros. (*Editor's Note: Correos, Spain's national postal service, offered a special service for pilgrims along the Camino Frances whereby for five euros per item, they could shuttle your luggage ahead to your next destination, saving you from carrying your pack yourself. The service is very convenient, you can either fill out an envelope with your contact information and your next albergue and deposit five euros inside the envelope, or you could arrange it all and pay online as well.*) 

While we were walking into town, a yellow Correos van passed us on the rural road, and I had even remarked that my towel may have been on that van. It probably was, because when we checked into the albergue, the host Laura (who spoke fluent French, German, and English in addition to Spanish) said the plastic bag with my towel had just arrived 10 minutes before we did.

After the usual shower (and this time having a towel to dry off with), I napped for a long time, then we went to the D&iacute;a Supermarket in town to buy the usual dinner baguette and breakfast for tomorrow morning.
