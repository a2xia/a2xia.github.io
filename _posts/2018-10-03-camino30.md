# On the Camino, Day 30: Portomar&iacute;n to Palas de Rei

### 94.7 km to Santiago de Compostela

Neither of us set an alarm this mroning, and we both slept until the albergue's lights were turned on at around 7:15. We ate the bread and had instant coffee in the kitchen before leaving at a leisurely 8:15; we were the second-last to leave. Despite leaving so late, the *Camino* was still full of pilgrims. (*Editor's Note: Many of the pilgrims we saw now weren't the familiar faces we had been seeing for most of our journey. Since the requirement to receive a completion certificate is to walk at least 100 kilometres, that 100 km to Santiago mark occured just yesterday, so many pilgrims we encounted today were like us in 2015, walking the minimally-required distance*).

It was very foggy this morning, but I still remembered some parts of the trail from three years ago. The first cafe on the route was incredibly busy, so we went to the second cafe on the trail for our morning coffees (the Casa Ortiz in Gonzar). We had lunch at the Meson Ligonde in Airexe, and arrived in Palas de Rei at a rather late 3 PM. Once again, we decided to stay at the same albergue as last time: the Albergue Outerio.
