# On the Camino, Day 4: Pamplona to Puente la Reina

### 708.3 km to Santiago de Compostela

We left the AirBnB in Pamplona quite early today at 7 AM, since there was no breakfast provided, and began walking to re-join the Camino trail since we had to make quite a detour yesterday. We walked along the riverside to the University of Navarre where we rejoined the main trail to leave Pamplona. We reached the first village outside the city, Cizur Menor, at around 8:30 and stopped for breakfast at the Restaurant Asador - two cafes con leche with an egg omelette for me.

We continued walking, past the village of Zariquiegui and climbed to the Alto de Perdon, and saddling the ridge we could see Pamplona on one side and the villages towards Puente la Reina on the other. We made the steep descent into the village of Uterga by noon, where we stopped for lunch at the Camino del Perdon Aubergue and Restaurant, which served an excellent Navarrian veal burger and soup.

The entire morning was quite cloudy, but it was clearing up, so we put on some sunscreen before moving on, an continued the walk past Muruzabal and Obanos before reaching the village of Puente la Reina (Gares in Basque) at around 3. I had phoned ahead and made a reservation at a place called the Aubergue Estrella Guia, so we went there right away and checked in, followed by the usual showering and clothes washing. After laundry and a short tea break, we went for a stroll thorugh the town and to the old Roman bridge for which the village was named after, and we also bought a loaf of bread for dinner back at the hostel.
