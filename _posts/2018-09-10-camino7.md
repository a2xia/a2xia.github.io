# On the Camino, Day 7: Los Arcos to Logro&ntilde;o

### 641.1 km to Santiago de Compostela

The aubergue we were staying at in Los Arcos had breakfast, but for an extra fee that we were not interested in paying for, so we walked to the village plaza agaain and back to the Cafeteria *Buen Camino* where we had dinner last night for some breakfast. We then started walking at around 7:20. We originally wanted to leave early today, since it was a long stage of the Camino, but in the end we didn't do that well in the timing department.

Today's stage out of Los Arcos brought us past Sansol and Torres del Rio before climbing to Alto Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Poyo and down into the village of Viana, which we arrived at noon in time for lunch. While eating, we noticed that there were lots of locals dressed in all white with red bandanas, and it turned out that today was their village's patron saint festival day, and that at 1 PM there would be a bull run down the main street. Our cafe was situated along the main drag, so when 1 rolled around, the store owner moved all the tables inside and barricaded us inside a fence. It turns out the bull run here isn't actually "Running with the Bulls" like in Pamplona, but rather they just had bulls running up and down the street and people just tried to mess with them. Since we were fenced in to the cafe, we couldn't leave either until the event was done at 1:30, and we continued our walk in the sun and heat towards Logro&ntilde;o.

A bit outside of the big city we passed by the provincial border, leaving the region of Navarra into the region of La Rioja, with Logro&ntilde;o being its capital. Since today's stage was already quite long, plus the delay after lunch, meant that we arrived at our destination for the night rather late at 4:30 PM. We decided to spring for a fancier place to sleep tonight in the bigger city, so we found a *pension* with a private room and shared bathrooms for forty Euros, the *Pension Sotelo*.

For dinner, we went out into the city and to a cafe that I found on Google Maps, the Cafe Delicias, since most restaurants didn't open for dinner until 8, of course. I had a burger and dad a salad, before we went to a nearby Carrefour to buy some bread and juice for tomorrow morning's breakfast before retiring for the night.
