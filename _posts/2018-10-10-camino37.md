Today's stage was very short - only about 13 kilometers between the two villages, because we extended what was planned as a three-day walk into a four stage one. So, I slept in until 7:30 at the Albergue Tequeron in Cee (the beds and bedding provided was really comfortable), and once I was up, had a relatively large self-fixed breakfast. Last night I had bought some cold cuts and donuts to have in addition to the complimentary breakfast the albergue provided, along with chicken noodle soup. We left at a leisurely (*Editor's note: I take note that this is perhaps the third time I've used the adjective "leisurely", so the next time I see it in my drafts it will be replaced with a synonym*) 8:30 to make the short walk around the bay to Finisterre.

We arrived at Finisterre at around noon, so we decided to have lunch first before checking in to the *pension* I had booked last night over the phone. We found the Cafe-Bar La Frontera, which had an extensive vegetarian menu, and we both had a vegetarian ravioli with mushrooms and cheese, which was really good. We then checked in to the Pension Cabo and dropped off our bags in our room on the fourth floor (no elevator, but they were really transparent about that during the booking process).

We then went and walked the last 3.5 kilometres of the official *Camino Fisterra* (or the first 3.5 kilometres, depending on which end you call the "end") to the Fisterra lighthouse. It was understandably windy at the Faro, and we quickly took pictures of the lighthouse and the "KM 0,00" signpost before returning to the village. We wanted to redeem our Finisterre Camino certificate (which can be redeemed if you prove that you've walked here from Santiago), but we found out that the Tourism Office that issued them was siesta-ing until 4 (at the time, it was still an hour away).

We then walked to the Coviran supermarket only to find that it too was closed until 5. So, we went back to the *pension* to shower and rest up. We went back downstairs at 5, and first to the Tourism Office, where we had to wait a good half hour to get our certificates, then we went to the supermarket - it turns out there was another one, a "Familia" supermarket (actually an Eroski in disguise), right next to our *pension*, so we shopped there for dinner.
