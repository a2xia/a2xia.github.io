# On the Camino, Day 33: Pedrouzo to Santiago de Compostela

### 19.8 km to Santiago de Compostela

Today was the last stage of the *Camino Frances* route to Santiago de Compostela. We wanted to make it to Santiago in time to catch the 12 noon pilgrims' mass, so we left the Albergue O Trisquel and Pedrouzo at 6:30 (after waking up at 5:30 for bread and Nescaf&eacute;) and walked through the dense woods in the dark. We passed by the Santiago de Compostela airport and had coffee and a French omelette (they call what North Americans expect to be an omelette a "French omelette") at the Casa Porta de Santiago in Lavacolla.

We passed by more familiar sights today, including the TV Galicia headquarters and the sculpture on Monte del Gozo. It started raining as we entered Santiago itself. We stopped at a Cafe-Bar Caminante at the outskirts of the city for dad to check his email (the *pension* we had booked said that we could drop off our bags as soon as we arrived) and for us to warm up and have a coffee.

We hustled our way through the city to the old sector, and found our room for the night - the Pension Resindencia Universitaria Rey and dropped off our bags. Turns out the room was ready anyway, so we changed into dry clothes before hurrying out to head to the Cathedral for mass.

Luckily, the Cathedral was just two streets over, a three minute walk. We found the entrance, now on Praza da Quintana (I remembered last time you could just walk in from the front door), and at first I thought there was a long line of people standing in a circle - turns out that was the line in and the line was so long it looped around the plaza. We stood in line for about fifteen minutes, until 12 passed, and decided it wasn't worth the wait considering it looked like we had to wait another half hour or so at least.

Instead, we went back to the *pension* to shower and rest. Last time we were here, mom wanted to try this restaurant that was highly recommended in Rick Steves' guidebook, the O Curro da Parra, but it was closed for the season. So, we wanted to eat there this time, but lunch service only started at 1:30. I made a reservation online thinking it would be some busy restaurant, but when we got there only one other table was occupied. (But it did indeed get busy as we were leaving near 3 PM - maybe because it was a Saturday and people are eating later). It was a high-end restaurant, which meant that the portions were small and prices high. I had the "melted b&eacute;chamel sauce and Ib&eacute;rico ham croquettes" to start, a half-portion of "supreme of hake, saffrom and citrus sauce, fried peppers and kumquats" as my main dish, and "(blow-torched) apple crumble, vanilla ice-cream and syrup" for dessert paired with their house white wine. The portions were indeed small and the bill was a whopping fifty euros.

After our long lunch, we went for a walk around the Cathedral and the old city, running into some familiar faces we met on the *Camino*. We also walked to the Pilgrims' Office to see if we could redeem our *Compostela*, but the line was incredibly long so we decided to come back later in the evening to try again.

It was already 6 when we headed out for our evening grocery run. We first tried the pilgrims' office again, and the line was still incredibly long. I asked a lady who had just exited and she estimated that the line was about an hour and a half long. We decided to come back when we return from Muxia.
