# On the Camino, Day 18: Terradillos to Bercianos del Real Camino

### 378.3 km to Santiago de Compostela

We noticed that other pilgrims have been starting their walks earlier and earlier now, for when we left Carri&oacute;n the day before at 6, there was already a large pack of pilgrims on the trail in the dark. So, we aimed to wake up at 5 this morning, and by 5:30 we were out on the trail. Even then all but two people in our dorm room were out as well. The first village of the day, Moratinos, was just over three kilometres awy, so when we got there it was still too early for a place to eat breakfast.

We continued onwards to the next village of San Nicol&aacute;s del Real Camino where the Casa Barrunta Bar was open, and we had our usual breakfast coffees and I had my usual egg (turns out it's actually potato) omelet.

We then reached the larger city of Sahag&uacute;n by 8:30, and dad was so cold that we decided to stop for another coffee to warm up. Sahag&uacute;n was just within the provincial border of the Province of Le&oacute;n, so today we crossed into our fifth Province of this cross-Spain walk (if I'm keeping track correctly, we've been through Navarra, La Rioja, Burgos, and Palencia).

We arrived at Bercianos at about 11:30, for today was a short stage. The guidebook only listed two albergues here, a private one that was booked full already, and a *parroquial* with no wi-fi. However, we passed by an *albergue* that turns out was new (opened September 2017) called Bercianos 1900, which did have wi-fi so we stayed here for ten euros a person.

We also had lunch in the attached restaurant downstairs, and then went for a stroll through the very quiet town and stopped by the only supermarket (more like a corner store) and bought some bread for dinner and pastries for tomorrow's breakfast.

I napped in the afternoon once again, and we ate bread at 6 and went for a stroll agin. Today we ran into a couple from Taiwan - for the first time on this walk we had met other Chinese speakers.
