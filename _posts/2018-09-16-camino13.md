# On the Camino, Day 13: Burgos to Hornillos del Camino

### 490.4 km to Santiago de Compostela

It turns out we both slept in this morning at our AirBnB in Burgos, because it was 7:30 by the time we woke up today. I grabbed a pastry to eat from the breakfast table (provided to us by our AirBnB host) and we were out of the house by 8. We didn't stop for coffee or anything today until we reached the first village out of Burgos, Tarjados, which was 10.5 km out of the city.

It was hot and sunny and dry once again today which made the walk quite miserable, even more so because it was through the flat, boring *meseta* region. In fact, we heard some groups of pilgrims deciding to just catch the train in Burgos and skip ahead to Le&oacute;n to avoid this boring stretch of walking. In Tarjados I was hungry, so I had a sausage and egg omelet before we continued.

We passed by just one other village today, Rab&eacute;, before arriving at our destination, Hornillos del Camino at around 1 PM after 21 kilometres. I didn't book anything here, so we just went door-to-door until we found one *albergue* that wasn't full yet, called the "Meeting Point Hostel", which was quite new in terms of facilities and just ten Euros each. At around 4 we went out for a walk around the village, and I bought a sandwich from the only store in town that was open and called that dinner.
