From Lonely Planet: "The views through Ella Gap are stunning, and on a clear night you can even spy the subtle glow of the Great Basses lighthouse on Sri Lanka's south coast. In recent years, Ella's popularity has soared and the town's attractiveness has been somewhat compromised by some multistory concrete eyesores". Unfortunately, Ella is indeed very much a tourist town when visited - a walk along the main street can find about a 50/50 split in foreigners/locals, and almost all restaurants/shops were clearly catered to a foreign clientele.

* 5:00a Ella Rock: A more demanding walk. Download maps.me for offline trail maps, as reports say enterprising locals deliberately give incorrect directions in hope of receiving payment as guides. Varying reports suggest anywhere from 2 to 5 hours round-trip. From Ella, follow the railway tracks in the direction of Badulla (south) until past the Kital Ella station. There is a trailhead that is a sharp turn in the reverse direction (precise location marked on maps.me). Shortly after turning off the train tracks, you will cross a bridge. After the bridge, there will be signs saying that the "shortest path" up Ella Rock is to the right at the fork. While this is technically true, the path is not obvious and at some points may be narrow, poorly maintained, or otherwise confusing. Follow the advice of many online reports and take a left at the fork. Took about 2 hours in total to reach the top (return took 1.5 hours). While the view was great, the view/effort ratio was not so great.
* 11:00a Checked out of Alta Vista Hotel, had beer and fries at bar near train station to wait for train.
* 2:00p Continued on the same local "Goods Train" as yesterday to the end of the Hill Country line, Badulla. This train was driven by a "Montreal" class engine donated by Canada under the Colombo Plan - it is still painted in recognizable VIA Rail colors. Sit on the left (Badulla direction) for views of Nine Arch Bridge and Demodara Loop. Approx. 1 hour to Badulla.
* 5:50p Pre-booked first class sleeping berth ticket on Night Mail sleeper train for Colombo. Apparently the sleeper train carriage was a hand-me-down from the Indian Railways system and honestly looked 50 or 60 or 80 years old. The bedsheets still had "CGR" on them, presumably for "Ceylon Government Railways", the pre-independence predecessor of today's Sri Lankan Government Railways. The berth had two bunks and between adjacent berts was a joining washroom. Had top bunk, but person in bottom bunk didn't come aboard until past Ella. Heavy rattling and shaking of the train (plus fact that train had to blow its whistle frequently) didn't make for a good night's sleep. Train arrived 2h45m late in Colombo the next morning.
