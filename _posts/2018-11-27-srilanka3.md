* Morning: Found out that in order to access the Galle Face lighthouse, I had to go south first and around the Kingsbury Hotel to loop around all the restricted areas. Quite a walk, and lighthouse itself is not very interesting because the port had been expanded and the lighthouse is now far from the actual shore. Also must be near an active military site, because there were soldiers patrolling the area with big rifles.
* Morning: Pettah Floating Market past the Fort Railway Station. Market seemed to be tourist-fied, and at time of visiting lacked both vendors and tourists.
* Morning: Dutch Christian Reformed Church; Red Masjid Mosque; Dutch History Museum (closed for renovations)
* Afternoon: Galle Face beach (walked past Canadian Embassy)
* Afternoon: Tea at Dilmah tea lounge - tea was good, teapot was absolutely innovative
* Dinner: Dutch Pub
