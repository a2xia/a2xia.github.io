# Sri Lanka Day 2: Colombo

Colombo is defined by its postcodes, with Colombo 1 being the important Fort neighbourhood and for example, Colombo 7 being Cinnamon Gardens, a wealthier neighbourhood. The Sri Lanka Tourist Board office has free literature in English and will help arrange guides (*80 Galle Rd, Colombo 3, T243 7059, M-F 8:30-16:15, Sat 8:30-12:30*). The Railway Tourist Office can help book train tickets and arrange cars with drivers. (*Fort Station, Colombo 11, T244 0048*).

* 7:00 Star Anise hostel provided breakfast: chicken sandwich, papaya, juice, tea and coffee. Pretty good.
* 7:30 Tried to find the Lighthouse (see tomorrow's entry), but it was blocked by a naval base, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Colombo Police Headquarters. No one I asked seemed to know how to get there either.
* 8:30 Took a Matale-bound train for Mount Lavinia (Rs 30), walked to beach and stopped for iced coffee. Took Uber from Dehiwala Railway Station to National Museum, Rs 445.29 (paid with app)
* 11:30 National Musem: A large 9th-century stone Buddha greets you as you enter Sri Lanka's premier cultural institution (Lonely Planet's words here). Interesting content, but be aware that there's no air conditioning or Wi-Fi here, for those who go to museums for those two aforementioned ameneties. (*Albert Cres, Col 7. Rs 1000 for foreign adults, 9a-6p, last entrance 5p*)
* 12:45 Lunch at the Colombo Cricket Club Cafe. The England (and Wales) Cricket team was on tour in Sri Lanka. (*For the cricket enthusiasts, this was the 3rd Test at SSC where England 336 (Bairstow 110, Stokes 57, Sandakan 5-95) and 230 (Buttler 64, Dilruwan 5-88) beat Sri Lanka 240 (Karunaratne 83, de Silva 73, Rashid 5-49) and 284 (Mendis 86, Roshen 65, Leach 4-72, Moeen 4-92) by 42 runs.*)
* 2:00 Travelled by Uber to Stef Lanka Travel Agency in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte to pick up pre-booked train tickets. Rs 189.90 and Rs 410.96 for Ubers.
* 6:30 Dinner at Colombo Bistro in the Dutch Hospital - cheap(er) plates and smaller portions than what I saw in other Fort district eateries. Rs 1539.
