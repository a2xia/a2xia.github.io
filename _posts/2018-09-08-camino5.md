# On the Camino, Day 5: Puente la Reina to Estella

### 684.5 km to Santiago de Compostela

I was up rather early today and was the first to go downstairs at the Albergue Estrella Guia and started the coffee machines and had some bread for breakfast. We were able to start walking rather early at 7 AM. Leaving Puente la Reina, we walked through the village of Ma&ntilde;eru and Cirauqui and arrived at the village of Lorca by just 11 AM. We stopped to have lunch at the La Bodega de Camino Auberge and Restaurant, where I had a mixed paella and we split a salad. After an hour-long lunch break, we continued walking, past Villatuerta and arriving at Estella at 2 PM.

Unlike the previous night, I didn't phone ahead to make a booking in Estella. Dad looked at the map and saw that the Parroquial de San Miguel was located in a central location, so we went there. Being a *parroquial*, it was run by the church (the Church of San Miguel was just across the street), and it was "by donation", so you can imagine that those choosing to stay there were all travellers on a shoestring. After doing the usual showering and clothes washing routine, I rested in bed while dad went for a walk around the village, especially to find new socks since he had a hole in his.

We found out that this week was the *49a Semana de Musica Antigua de Estella* - the 49th Annual Week of Ancient Music in Estella, and all week they had concerts in the churches in the area. This evening, there was a program of Handel and Scarlatti (I guess that's "ancient" enough), so we decided to get dinner and go.

Dinner, at 6 PM, was at the nearby Restaurant Mundo, which was run by a lady that looked more Dutch than Spanish to me and spoke impressively good English. They had a good menu and good portion sizes (i.e., not too large), and I had a fried rice with egg with soup and a sorbet. After dinner, it began pouring rain as forecasted, so we returned to the aubergue to move our bags indoors.

The concert began at 8:15 and we went to the church at 7:45 to buy tickets at the door for 12 Euros each. The performing group tonight was the *Musica Boscareccia* group, and the theme of the performance was "Rome 1709: Handel vs Scarlatti". 

The program included 
* Handel's Cantata for Soprano, Two Violins and basso continuio, *"Agrippina condotta a morire"* HWV 110;
* Scarlatti's Sonata in D minor for two violins and basso continuo;
* Handel's Trio Sonata in G minor, op. 12 no. 6, HWV 391; and
* Scarlatti's Cantata for Soprano, two violins, and basso continuo, *"Pur nel sonno al men tal'ora"*

The concert (which was very good, in my opinion), went on until about 9:50 and included an encore of course, and we returned to the aubergue just in time before it closed at 10.
