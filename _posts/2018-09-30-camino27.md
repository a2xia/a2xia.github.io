# On the Camino, Day 27: O'Cebreiro to Triacastela

### 154.5 km to Santiago de Compostela

Since today's stage was a bit shorter at 20.7 km and mostly downhill, we decided to sleep in a little to 5:30, and began walking at 6:30 after checking out of the Hotel Cebreiro. We psased by the villages of Li&ntilde;ares and Hospital de la Condesa (nothing in either village) and had breakfast at Albergue del Puerto Padorneio. We then passed through Fonfria, Biduedo, Filloval, Villoval (real creative names here), Pasantes, and Ramil before arriving in Triacastela. The views today were quite beautiful, in the morning the low-lying clouds made the mountains look like floating islands.

The descent was steep at parts, but the Galician government took good care of the trail and it wasn't too difficult of a walk. We were able to have lunch in Triacastela before checking in to the our albergue because we booked ahead yesterday, so we had lunch at Cafe O Peregrino, and dad even had a Galician soup to go with his meal. After eating, we checked in to the Albergue and Pension Lemos. For dinner, we had the usual bread from a nearby supermarket, which tasted really good today (I think it's because it was freshly baked and still warm).
