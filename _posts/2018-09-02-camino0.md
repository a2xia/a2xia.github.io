# Before the Camino, Day 0: Bayonne to St-Jean-Pied-de-Port

Today's plan was to explore a bit of Bayonne itself before catching a regional train to the starting point of our *Camino* walk, St-Jean. We checked out of our hotel room at 10 and left our bags with the front desk and walked into the city of Bayonne to visit the Museum of Basque Culture. We arrived just at the right time to visit on free admission day, which takes place on the first Sunday of every month. The receptionist gave each of us a booklet in English (since the displays were in French, Euskarian, and Spanish).

For lunch, we strolled to the Les Halles market, but we couldn't find anything to suit our tastes, so we found a place off the main plaza called Westfarm where I had a salad bowl. After lunch, we walked back to our hotel across the street from the train station to get our bags, and then we bought two tickets for the TER regional train for St-Jean-Pied-de-Port, a small branch line that starts right here in Bayonne.

St-Jean-Pied-de-Port (not to be confused with the nearby St-Jean-de-Luz-Ciboure which was on the Bordeaux-Hendaye TER route that we passed by on yesterday's train ride) was the most popular starting point for the *Camino de Santiago* on the most popular *Camino* route, the *Camino Frances*. In reality, the route can be traced even further east to places such as Paris, Switzerland, and Germany, and some people spend even more time walking from places further beyond our starting point.

St-Jean-PP perhaps got its claim as the "de facto" starting point for this was where the 12th-Century *Codice Calixtino* "guidebook" began.

The train from Bayonne was scheduled to leave at 14:52, and it was one of only three departures on a Sunday, with the other two at 7 in the morning and 9 at night, which meant that there were a lot of pilgrims on the platform, even half an hour before the train was due to leave. Unfortunately, the train was a one-carriage TER train and there must've been about 200 people waiting. Indeed, when the doors opened ten minutes prior to departure time, the train was standing-only and packed. Finally, an attendant had to get on the train and announce (in French and English) that they were adding a second carriage to the train. However, there seemed to be only one driver available, and he had to walk all the way to the rail yards to fetch the second carriage and drive it to the platform and connect the two together, meaning that we were delayed by 20 minutes.

At St-Jean (*Donibane Garazi* in Euskara), we joined the parade of pilgrims to the town centre, where we found our B&B for the night, the *Gite* Mekila. After checking in, we went for a walk around the village, such as the ramparts and the castle, then went to the Pilgrim's Office to pick up our *credencials*, our stampbook to complete on our way to Santiago (to prove that we actually walked the distance).
