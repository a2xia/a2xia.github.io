# On the Camino, Day 6: Estella to Los Arcos

### 662.6 km to Santiago de Compostela

Since I slept late last night (plus the beds at the *parroquial* albergue were very uncomfortable), I slept in a bit and woke up late at 7 this morning. There wasn't really any breakfast food, so I put on my socks and shoes and we went straight out and began walking by 7:20.

Today's segment of the walk first brought us to the village of Ayegui, where there was a wine fountain courtesy of a local vineyard. However, the information plaque said that they only loaded it with 100 L of wine each day, and the tap was dry so either we got up late or people ahead of us were heavy drinkers. We continued past Irache and climbed up to Villamayor de Montjardin, where we took a stop to put on sunscreen, and then onwards towards Los Arcos.

Unfortunately, there wasn't any village for this 9 km-or-so long stretch, but there was a food truck about 6 km out of Los Arcos, so that was where we (and many others) stopped for a simple lunch. I had a sub-par burger and dad a veggie sandwich before we continued walking.

Today's segment was relatively short at only about 21 km, so we arrived at Los Arcos at only 1:40 PM. I had phoned ahead last night and made a reservation at the Aubergue La Fuente Casa de Austria. Not my first choice, which was booked full, but it was a private aubergue and the reviews were decent enough. We paid eighteen Euros for the two of us.

For dinner, we went out to the town square (Los Arcos wasn't big, and clearly has seen better economic times) and had a light vegetarian dinner at a cafeteria, then took a quick stroll around the village before returning to the aubergue.
