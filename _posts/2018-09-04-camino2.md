# On the Camino, Day 2: Roncesvalles to Zubiri
### 751.1 km to Santiago de Compostela

Well, today's segment actually started about 5 km out from Roncesvalles due to our short taxi ride last night to Camping Urrobi. I was so tired that when I finally woke up at 7:30, it was just us and two Russian cyclists left. The campground didn't serve breakfast, so we packed our stuff and headed out. The campground was about 1 km off the Camino trail itself, so we had to walk a bit along the highway until the village of Espinal (Aurizberri) where we re-joined the trail and encountered a steady stream of pilgrims.

We wanted to stop for breakfast here but it didn't seem like anyone was serving anything more than coffee (it's like the Balkan Breakfast Problem all over again!) so we just refilled our water bottles and pressed on. Today's segment wasn't as bad as yesterday's with the 1000+ metres of elevation gain, and listening to music made it a lot better too. We reached the village of Viskarret (Guerendiain) at around 10, and we stopped at the first cafe along the route where I had a cafe con leche with an egg omelette for breakfast.

We pretty much continued walking from there without any breaks until we reached Zubiri at around 1:40 PM. Since we had a 5 km head start, we thought about continuing onwards to the next village, but first we stopped for some lunch. Over lunch, I tried to call some aubergues in the next village, but none of them answered, so we decided to not risk heading over there and not finding a place to stay, and instead opted to stay in Zubiri.

Once again, our first chocie aubergue was full, and the owner led us around the small village until he found a place that had beds available, and so we checked in for the night. For dinner, we went to the supermarket and split a loaf of bread. (*Editor's note: This will become a common theme for the rest of the trip, where dinner is more or less a loaf of bread, sometimes with some beer.*)
