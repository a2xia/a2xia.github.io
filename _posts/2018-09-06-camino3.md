# On the Camino, Rest Day: Pamplona

Today was the first scheduled rest day from the Camino to be spent in the city of Pamplona, so accordingly I slept in until 10 AM. (*Editor's Note: Despite scheduling additional rest days along the trip, this would end up being the only rest day actually taken*) Since the AirBnB was located in a residential neighbourhood, we had to walk about forty minutes before we got to the city centre. We found a cafe where I had a breakfast of an egg omelette again with a cafe con leche, then we walked to the bullring and did Rick Steves' guided walk of Pamplona but in reverse. (*Editor's Note: Rick Steves' guide to Spain is highly recommended*) We passed by the Monument to the Bullrun of the San Fermin festival and along the famous bullrun route to the city hall and to the Cathedral, where we got a stamp for our *credencial*.

We stopped for lunch near the city hall at the Restaurant La Vina, which had a set menu lunch that I paid for on my Deutsche Bank card, then we walked aroud the old town, but it was approaching *siesta* time, meaning that many stores and sights were closing, so we ended up buying some sandwiches for dinner from a Carrefour Express and walked back to the AirBnb.
