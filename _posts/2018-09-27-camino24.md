# On the Camino, Day 24: Foncebad&oacute;n to Ponferrada

### 233.8 km to Santiago de Compostela

Today's stage was slightly adjusted to evenly distribute the distances of stages 26-28 in the guidebook, which had today's stage going from Rabanal del Camino (which we passed yesterday) to Molinaseca (which we passed today). We left the albergue in Foncebad&oacute;n at our usual 6 AM departure time. Since we thought it would be quite cold at this high elevation, I wore my long pants and a sweater. However, the weather looked like it was going to rain today, and indeed it was very humid outside possibly in anticipation of the rain, so we didn't walk far before I changed into shorts again.

We reached the highest point of the Camino today, the Alto Altar at 1,515 metres above sea level. From there, it was a long and steep descent towards Ponferrada, and the trail conditions were poor, so it hurt the knees and ankles going down. We passed by the villages of Manjarin (apparently population 1: the *hospitalero* of the albergue there), El Acebo (we stopped for our usual breakfast coffee at the La Casa del Peregrino here) and Riego de Ambros before stopping in Molinaseca for lunch at Meson el Palacio.

After lunch, we finished the last five kilometres into Ponferrada, a large city with a population of about 70,000. Despite the large population, there actually weren't many albergues here, which was why I booked ahead on Booking.com for two beds at the Albergue Guiana, which had sufficiently high ratings. We checked in at 2, and the dorm room was quite nice, it had seven beds, the other five being occupied by four Koreans and a Chinese-speaking Taiwanese fellow all walking together. After checking in, we went out to buy our dinner baguette and beer from the Gadis supermarket (the D&iacute;a supermarket in town, usually the brand we've been going to, had a really long and late siesta time so they were closed when we went by).

After dinner, we went for a stroll to see the sights in Ponferrada. It had a 12th-century Templar Castle, the Castillo de los Templarios, and an impressive Clock Tower and City Hall.
