    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>You didn't ask, but here's everything you didn't want to know about me but get to know anyway.</p>

      	<h3>About Me, Briefly</h3>
	<p>I was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada where I gained a love for the outdoors, travelling, the West Coast, and politics. Ever since I was a little child, I was interested in news and current events. As I entered high school, I became more politically involved, volunteering with my Member of Parliament and his political party as well as travelling to the nation's capital, Ottawa, several times to participate in youth political forums.</p>
	<p>I was also very bad at technology, and the two things I told myself that I'd have nothing to do with in university were computers and engineering.</p>
	<p>So, it makes sense that I am currently a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</p>

	<h3>Aknowledgements</h3>
	<p>Many thanks go to the following people:<br />
	In Waterloo: Thank you to MA-A, TR, NC, SM, AP, DY, MA, and TX for keeping me sane through these tumultuous times. Additional thanks to Dr. Chen for his academic guidance and wisdom.<br />
	In Vancouver: Thank you to JJC, ML, AL, and MG for staying in touch and supporting me on this crazy decision.<br />
	In Beijing: Thanks to 2G/2GF for housing me, HJJ for being a lenient boss, SJC for being a talented know-it-all, and ZWP for taking me in on day one and beyond.</p>

	<h4>"Frequently" Asked Questions</h4>
	<p><b>Why are there never any pictures of you?</b><br />
	I'm very camera shy, and I definitely wouldn't put up a picture of myself on a public page like this. If you know me, you know what I look like. If you don't know me, you don't need to know what I look like.</p>

	<p><b>Where are you right now?</b><br />
	As of June 2017, I am  in Beijing, China for the work term. In August I will be somewhere in Eastern Europe, and then back home to Vancouver for two weeks of much-needed family time, plus a trip to Alaska. In September I'll be back in Waterloo for the 2A term.</p>

	<p><b>What should I listen to?</b><br />
	<i>If you're in a happy mood:</i> I recommend Mozart's Requiem sung by The Choir of King's College, conducted by Stephen Cleobury. It will make you sad.<br />
	<i>If you're in a bad mood:</i> I recommend Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op.64, MWVO14 as recorded by Anne-Sophie Mutter and the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig with Kurt Masur. It'll make you even sadder.<br />
	<i>If classical music's not your jam:</i> There's <i>Waterloo</i> by ABBA, <i>Chained to the Rhythm</i> by Katy Perry, or <i>Green Light</i> by Lorde.</p>

	<p><b>What should I read?</b><br />
	Currently, I'm reading <i>The Idea of Canada: Letters to a Nation</i> by former UW President David Johnston. I think after his tenure as President here he went on to become Governor General of Canada or something. I'm also looking forward to reading <i>The Casual Vacancy</i> by J.K. Rowling.</p>

	<p><b>Are you good at coding?</b><br />
	...</p>

	<p><b>Should I drop out of ECE?</b><br />
	<i>Whatever floats your boat and whatever sinks your ship, pal.</i></p>

	<p><b>Can you help me with the [course number] lab?</b><br />
	No.</p>
