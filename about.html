    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>You didn't ask, but here's everything you didn't want to know about me but get to know anyway.</p>

      	<h3>Get in Touch</h3>
	<p>Before you do, ask yourself, "do I <i>really</i> need to bother Andrew"?<br />
	If the answer is 'Yes', you can reach me at andrew.xia -at- uwaterloo.ca.<br />
	I'm also reachable at +86 132-6330-8956. Good luck with that, though.<br />

	Note to self: The header size is changed in the main.scss file at line 1702, breakpoint(large) @padding include.</p>

	<h3>My Story</h3>
	When I was in kindergarten, my kindergarten teacher asked me, "Andrew, what do you want to be when you grow up?". I replied to her, "I want to be the Prime Minister". She gave me a chuckle, patted my head, and said, "Good for you, I'll vote for you."<br />
	<br />

	In senior year of high school, my career advisor asked me, "Andrew, what do you want to be when you graduate?". I replied to him, "I want to be the Prime Minister". <br />

	<br />

	He gave me a chuckle and said, "Why don't you choose something more realistic? How about Software Engineering?".<br />
	<br />

	I was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada where I attended elementary and secondary school. Ever since I was a little child, I was interested in news and current events. As I entered high school, I became more politically involved, volunteering with my Member of Parliament and his political party as well as attending several youth political forums. <br />
	<br />
	Thus, it made sense that I decided to go to McGill University and study in their Bachelor of Arts and Science program for a BASc - a Bachelor's of Arts and Science - degree. I had applied to, and got accepted to the program in McGill. I paid my tuition deposit, began looking for residence in Montreal, and even took AP French in high school.<br />
	<br /> 
	Then three days before the deadline, I switched to Waterloo Computer Engineering, a back-up choice since applications to Ontario schools had to be made in batches of three.<br />
	<br />
	The two things I told myself that I'd have nothing to do with in university were computers (I hate technology) and engineering (other people can solve these problems for me). So it makes sense now that I'm in Waterloo Computer Engineering.<br />
	<br />

	In Beijing: Thanks to 2G/2GF for housing me, HJJ for being a lenient boss, SJC for being a talented know-it-all, and ZWP for taking me in on day one and beyond.</p>

	<h4>"Frequently" Asked Questions</h4>
	<p><b>Why are there never any pictures of you?</b><br />
	I'm very camera shy, and I definitely wouldn't put up a picture of myself on a public page like this. If you know me, you know what I look like. If you don't know me, you don't need to know what I look like.</p>

	<p><b>How did you make this website?</b><br />With a combination of Markdown, HTML, YAML; powered by Jekyll using Bash for Linux for Windows and Powershell, and many hours of frustration and difficulty. "Easy to make blogs" my ass.</p>

	<p><b>Where am I right now?</b><br />
	As of June 2017, I am (unfortunately) in Beijing, China for the work term. In August I will be somewhere in Eastern Europe (read: former-Commie-land), and then back home to Vancouver for two weeks of much-needed family time, plus a trip to Alaska. In September I'll be back in Waterloo for the 2A term.</p>

	<p><b>What should I listen to?</b><br />
	<i>If you're in a happy mood:</i> I recommend Mozart's Requiem sung by The Choir of King's College, conducted by Stephen Cleobury. It will make you sad.<br />
	<i>If you're in a bad mood:</i> I recommend Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op.64, MWVO14 as recorded by Anne-Sophie Mutter and the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig with Kurt Masur. It'll make you even sadder.<br />
	<i>If classical music's not your jam:</i> There's <i>Waterloo</i> by ABBA, <i>Chained to the Rhythm</i> by Katy Perry, or <i>Green Light</i> by Lorde.</p>

	<p><b>What should I read?</b><br />
	Currently, I'm reading <i>The Idea of Canada: Letters to a Nation</i> by former UW President David Johnston. I think after his tenure as President here he went on to become Governor General of Canada or something. I'm also looking forward to reading <i>The Casual Vacancy</i> by J.K. Rowling.</p>

	<p><b>Are you good at coding?</b><br />
	LOL.</p>

	<p><b>Should I drop out of ECE?</b><br />
	<i>Whatever floats your boat and whatever sinks your ship, pal.</i></p>

	<p><b>Can you help me with the [course number] lab?</b><br />
	No.</p>
