# About Andrew Xia

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Right now, I am on a co-operative education work term at Intel with the Programmable Solutions Group, working on implementing Intel's next-generation memory protocol on Intel Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

When I'm not at work or at school, I enjoy travelling (of course, on hold due to the pandemic) and following various sports (ice hockey (Vancouver Canucks), cricket, road cycling (Trek-Segafredo) and Formula 1). I also love passenger trains and whenever possible, I'll take the train over flying or taking the bus.

## About this Website
This website was built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted with GitHub pages. This site's theme is *mostly* built out of a Jekyll theme called "<a href="https://github.com/ronv/ultra">Ultra</a>" created by Ronalds Vilci&#326;&#353;.

<small>Like many others in my field, I would probably include in the footer "Built with &#9825; in Vancouver, BC", but let's be honest, this was built more with frustration and trial-and-error rather than love.</small>
